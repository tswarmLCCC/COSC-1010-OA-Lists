Activity: Modify the Code

This program has a hardcoded list of movies. Your goal is to make it interactive!

Your goal:
1.  Modify the code so that instead of a predefined list, it starts with an *empty* list.
2.  Use the `input()` function to ask the user for their favorite movie.
3.  Use the `append()` method to add the user's input to your empty list.
4.  Run the program and enter a movie to see if it works!
